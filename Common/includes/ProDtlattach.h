Purpose: Allocate and initialize the memory for a detail attachment.

Input Arguments:

    type            - The attachment type (FREE, PARAMETRIC or OFFSET).
    view            - The view.  Use only if the attachment type is set to 
                       PRO_DTLATTACHTYPE_FREE, to make an attachment relative 
		       to a drawing view. Use NULL to attach to a point 
		       unconnected to a drawing view and for solid model 
		       annotations.
    location        - The attachment location.  Use if
                       the attachment type is set to PRO_DTLATTACHTYPE_FREE 
		       or PRO_DTLATTACHTYPE_OFFSET.
		       For drawing objects and symbols and surface finish on
		       flat-to-screen annotation planes, this should be in
		       screen coordinates.  For symbols and surface finish on
		       3D model annotation planes, this should be in model 
		       coordinates.
    attach_point    - The attachment point.  Use if the attachment type is
                       PRO_DTLATTACHTYPE_PARAMETRIC or 
		       PRO_DTLATTACHTYPE_OFFSET.
		       For drawing attachments, the drawing view and 
		       attachment reference must be specified as a part of 
		       this structure created using ProSelect(), or by using 
		       ProSelectionAlloc () plus ProSelectionViewSet() and 
		       ProSelectionPoint3dSet().
    
Output Arguments:

    PRO_TK_BAD_INPUTS    - Bad one or more input arguments.
    PRO_TK_INVALID_TYPE  - Bad type.
