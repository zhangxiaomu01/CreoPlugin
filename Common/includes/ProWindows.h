   Purpose: Closes the currently active window.
            This function duplicates the behavior of the 
            Close pick on the Window
            pull-down menu from the menu bar.
            <p>
            If the current window is the original window created when
            Creo Parametric started, the function clears the window. Otherwise, 
            the function removes the window from the screen.
            <p>
            NOTES:
            <ul>
            <li>Any work done since the last save will be lost.
            <li>This function does not take effect until control returns to 
                Creo Parametric.
            <li>When a call is made to this function, 
            the control should be returned to Creo Parametric 
            to close the current window.
            </ul>
