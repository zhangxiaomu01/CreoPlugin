	PRO_TK_NOT_DISPLAYED - The item is not currently displayed and so 
                               cannot be added to the buffer.
	PRO_TK_BAD_CONTEXT - The selection cannot be added to the buffer in 
	                     combination with one or more objects that are 
			     already in the buffer (e.g. geometry and 
			     features selected at the same time).
	PRO_TK_GENERAL_ERROR - The function failed to add the requested item 
	                       to the buffer.
        PRO_TK_CANT_MODIFY - Buffer modification is prohibited.
        PRO_TK_MULTIBODY_UNSUPPORTED - input collection is not supported in
