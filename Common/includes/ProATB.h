/*
Purpose: To Verify if the ATB models are out of date. This function will first
          check to see if the model specified is a TIM (of some master model).
          If model is not a TIM, it will check to see if the model contains one
          or more features which are TIM representations of some model from
          ICEM.

		  <b>Note:</b> In Creo 3 this function does not support names longer 
		  than 80 characters. It will return PRO_TK_BAD_INPUTS for longer names. 
		  The support for ProMdlFileName will be added in a future release. 

Input Arguments:

        model   -  Creo Parametric Part or Assembly that is
                   a) A TIM representation of a model imported from the ATB
                      interface such as CADDS/CATIA
                   b) A Creo Parametric Assembly containing one or more components which
                      are model imported from an ATB Interface such as
                      CADDS/CATIA
                   c) A Creo Parametric Part containing an Import Feature that is imported
                      from an ATB Interface such as ICEM.

        feat_ids - ProArray of feature id(s). Indicates one or more ATB-Enabled
                   feature(s) in the model. In that case, the ATB Verify
                   operation will only work on the Feature(s) specified.
                   If NULL, then the function will attempt to verify the entire
                   model (TIM from CADDS/CATIA).

        search_paths - ProArray of ProPath(s) indicating the set of additional
                      directories to be searched for the master model. If NULL, then
                      the function will search in current working directory or locations
                      set in config-option atb_search_path.


Output Arguments:

        models_out_of_date - ProArray of ProMdlFileName(s) to represent the set of
                             models out of date, which can be relinked. This
                             maps to the models that show up as RED in the UI.
                             Pass NULL if not interested.
                             Free this argument using ProArrayFree.

        models_unlinked    - ProArray of ProMdlFileName(s) to represent the set of
                             unlinked models. This maps to the models that show
                             up as YELLOW in the UI (with the broken link).
                             Pass NULL if not interested.
                             Free this argument using ProArrayFree.

        models_old_version - ProArray of ProMdlFileName(s) to represent the set of
                             models of older version. This maps to the models
                             that show up as YELLOW in the UI (with the broken
                             link). Pass NULL if not interested.
                             Free this argument using ProArrayFree.

PRO_TK_NO_ERROR    -    The function successfully verified the model and
                        found ONE or more models out of date.

                        found ONE or more models of older version and found no
                        ATB models out of date.                        
PRO_TK_BAD_CONTEXT -     The function successfully verified the model,
                        found ONE or more models with broken link and found no
