                         identification string returned by 
                         ProEngineerConnectIdExtract. If it is ID string, the

			 specified Creo Parametric session; if this attempt fails,
			 the application will try to connect to any Creo Parametric
			 session.
     display          -  The name of the display Creo Parametric
                         is using. If this is NULL, match any display.

                         assume the current user.
     textpath         -  The path under which the Creo Parametric TOOLKIT message
                         and menu files are held. This is used in full
                         asynchronous mode, or in simple asynchronous mode if
			 text files are read (e.g., ProMessageToBuffer() is
			 called). Otherwise, pass a null string.
     allow_random     -  If there is more than one Creo Parametric matching the constraints
                         specified in arguments "display" and "user", choose one at random
                         if this argument is PRO_B_TRUE; if it is PRO_B_FALSE, return an

                         and the function arbitrarily chose one Creo Parametric 
                         session.

     p_handle         -  A pointer to a process handle to be used in
                         subsequent calls to Creo Parametric.

  Return Values:
     PRO_TK_NO_ERROR      - The connection succeeded.
     PRO_TK_CANT_ACCESS   - No network access.
     PRO_TK_NOT_EXIST     - No Creo Parametric session exists.

     PRO_TK_CANT_OPEN     - Cannot process request for connection to
                            Creo Parametric session.
     PRO_TK_E_DEADLOCK    - The application and Creo Parametric deadlocked while
                            trying to make a connection.
     PRO_TK_E_NOT_FOUND   - No Creo Parametric session with the specified
     			    characteristics could be found, or information on
     		 	    the session could not be read from the name server.
     PRO_TK_E_BUSY        - Creo Parametric session did not respond to request for
                            initialization within <b>timeout_sec</b> seconds.
     PRO_TK_E_AMBIGUOUS   - More than one Creo Parametric session with the specified

             <li>When it is outside the event loop, the application should
                 unbind the notification function to avoid blocking

   Output Arguments:

   Return Values:

      PRO_TK_GENERAL_ERROR - The function failed.

extern ProError ProAsynchronousEventLoop ( void );
/*
    Purpose: Initiates an event loop which will call ProEventProcess 
             periodically(1sec) to handle events returned from Creo Parametric.  
             Applicable only for full asynchronous applications which are not 
             supposed to carry out any tasks while waiting for Creo Parametric events.
             <P>
             IMPORTANT NOTE: This function will not return until interrupted by 
             ProAsynchronousEventLoopInterrupt() or an error returns from 
             ProEngineerStatusGet().  No separate application processing is 
             possible until that time, except within Creo Parametric event callbacks.
             

    Input Arguments:
        none

    Output Arguments:
        none

    Return Values:
        PRO_TK_USER_ABORT - The function was interrupted by 
                            ProAsynchronousEventLoopInterrupt().
        Any other value - ProEngineerStatusGet() returned this error.

    Purpose: Call this function from within a Creo Parametric callback function to halt a

    Input Arguments:
        none

    Purpose: Returns the connection id for the Creo Parametric session that this

             can be passed to external asynchronous applications to allow them
             to connect to this Creo Parametric session.

                          asynchronous process to connect to this Creo Parametric
