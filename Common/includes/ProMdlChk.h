/*

  Purpose:      To run ModelCheck and extract the results.

  Input Arguments:
    mdl                 - The model on which ModelCheck is to be executed
    show_ui             - PRO_B_TRUE to show the ModelCheck results in the
                          browser, PRO_B_FALSE to skip this.
                          ModelCheck configuration "SHOW_REPORT" in config_init.mc file
                          overrides show_ui value.				  
    mc_mode             - The mode used to execute ModelCheck.
    config_dir          - The location of the ModelCheck configuration 
                          directory.  The configuration directory should be
                          named 'config'.  If  NULL, the default ModelCheck 
                          config directory will be used.
    output_dir          - The directory to which the reports files should be
                          written.  If NULL, the default 
                          ModelCheck output directory will be used.

  Output Arguments:
    errors              - The number of errors found
    warnings            - The number of warnings found
    model_saved         - PRO_B_TRUE if the model is saved with updates and 
                          PRO_B_FALSE otherwise.


  Return Values:
    PRO_TK_NO_ERROR     -   The function succeeded.
    PRO_TK_BAD_INPUTS   -   One or more input arguments was invalid.
    PRO_TK_E_NOT_FOUND  -   The function failed to find config directoy 
                            specified. 
    PRO_TK_GENERAL_ERROR -   Failure due to any other reasons
    PRO_TK_NO_LICENSE   -   Creo Parametric is missing the license to execute
                            ModelCheck.
